   <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

   <p>Last updated: <strong>December 3, 2025</strong></p>

   <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
   <p>
      This TikTok Video Uploader ("Application") is operated by <strong>Gared Berns</strong>
      ("we", "us"). If you have any questions about this policy, you can contact us at
      <a href="mailto:johnwalkerser@gmail.com">johnwalkerser@gmail.com</a>.
   </p>

   <h2>2. What this application does</h2>
   <p>
      The Application allows you to upload video content to your TikTok account using TikTok’s
      official Content Posting API. The Application does not provide analytics, advertising,
      or any additional data processing beyond what is necessary to upload your videos.
   </p>

   <h2>3. Data we access via TikTok</h2>
   <p>Through TikTok’s APIs, we may access the following information:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>your TikTok account ID (open_id or similar identifier);</li>
      <li>your display name;</li>
      <li>your profile avatar URL;</li>
      <li>video files that you choose to upload through the Application.</li>
   </ul>

   <p>
      We do <strong>not</strong> collect your TikTok password, email address, or other
      sensitive authentication information. Authentication is handled directly by TikTok.
   </p>

   <h2>4. How we use the data</h2>
   <p>The information listed above is used exclusively to:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>authenticate your TikTok session via TikTok’s official login/authorization flow;</li>
      <li>upload videos that you explicitly select to your TikTok account (for example, as drafts or posts);</li>
      <li>display basic account information (such as display name or avatar) inside the Application interface, if applicable.</li>
   </ul>

   <h2>5. Data storage and retention</h2>
   <p>
      We do not permanently store personal data retrieved from TikTok on our own servers.
      Any data processed by the Application is used only for the duration of the upload
      and is discarded once the operation is complete, except where TikTok itself stores
      the content on its own platform in accordance with TikTok’s terms and policies.
   </p>

   <p>
      We do not build long-term profiles of users, and we do not use your data for
      marketing, advertising, or resale.
   </p>

   <h2>6. Sharing of data with third parties</h2>
   <p>
      We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal data to third parties.
      Data may be processed by service providers that are strictly necessary
      to operate the Application (for example, hosting providers or TikTok itself),
      but only to the extent required to provide the core upload functionality.
   </p>

   <h2>7. Your choices and rights</h2>
   <ul>
      <li>
         You may revoke the Application’s access to your TikTok account at any time
         from your TikTok account settings.
      </li>
      <li>
         If you no longer wish to use the Application, simply stop using it and,
         if applicable, remove its access via TikTok’s security/permissions page.
      </li>
      <li>
         You can contact us at <a href="mailto:johnwalkerser@gmail.com">johnwalkerser@gmail.com</a>
         if you have questions about how your data is processed in connection with this Application.
      </li>
   </ul>

   <h2>8. Children’s privacy</h2>
   <p>
      This Application is not directed to children under the age defined by applicable
      law in your jurisdiction. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children
      through this Application. If you believe that a child has provided us with personal
      information, please contact us so that we can take appropriate action.
   </p>

   <h2>9. Changes to this policy</h2>
   <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the
      Application or legal requirements. The "Last updated" date at the top of this
      page indicates when the latest version came into effect.
   </p>

   <p>
      Your continued use of the Application after changes are posted constitutes your
      acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.
